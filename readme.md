## What's this?
An embarrassingly simple Java XML writer, inspired by the Groovy XmlBuilder. Not much better than generating by hand, but at least it saves you having to close all tags.

## How do I use it?
Just drop the file into your project, and have fun! See the [tests](test/net/luminis/xmlbuilder/XmlTest.java) for some inspiration on how to use it.
